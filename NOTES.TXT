Sequence file upload task

FILE UPLOADER MVP - ADD SEQUENCE FILES
- Duplicate process for deleting files

DOWNLOAD ACTUAL SEQUENCE FILES IN SHOW.ejs
- Each file is just a string of file name
- Can download with button

MODAL POPUP - ADD SEQUENCE FILES
- Use suggested bookmark to get MVP
    = put at top or bottom of page?
- Closes and refreshes page
    = ensure all files are uploaded before admin-user can do this
- Incorporates file uploader

FINAL TOUCHES
- Add areyousure to delete sequence file
- test everything again (idiot-proof)
- prepare = present to Martin (mention stretch goals)

STRETCH GOALS (discuss with Martin)
- Tick once file is downloaded (simple event listener)

FINALLY
- send screenshots to customer over email
